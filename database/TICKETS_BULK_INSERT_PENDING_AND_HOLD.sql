-- Bulk INSERT into public.tickets from support_tickets_upload.tsv
-- Run TICKETS_ADD_SUPPORT_COLUMNS.sql first. Requires at least one company and one user_profiles row.
-- Page names are visible in UI when public.pages is populated (id, name) and page_id is set; this insert sets page_id via subquery.
-- Reference numbers: BU-xxxx (bugs), CH-xxxx (chores), FE-xxxx (features). New submissions continue after last ref (e.g. FE-0219).
-- Descriptions include "Old Ref: X Time Delay: N days" for legacy tracking. query_arrival_at = NOW() - N days so system time delay matches.
